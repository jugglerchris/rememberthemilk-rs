# rememberthemilk-rs

Rust crate for the [Remember The Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com) API.

This includes a library implementing the implementing the main API methods and
a command-line utility to make use of it.  It is currently very incomplete, but
can do the basics of listing and adding tasks.

I expect the functionality to fill out over time as I want or need them, and
my priorities are influenced by polite feature or pull requests.

# Contributing

Bug reports, feature requests, general queries, and pull requests welcome.  The
CI runs cargo test, cargo fmt and cargo clippy, but these are not a
prerequisite for me accepting a PR - in general if the PR is otherwise good I'm
happy to just fix those up myself before merging.

For any larger changes, I suggest discussing in an issue first to check it's in
the right direction before wasting time.
